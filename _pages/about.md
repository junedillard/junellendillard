Hello! I'm Junellen Dillard - a data-oriented policy advisor, passionate about building equitable, efficient systems. 

I currrently serve as a Policy Advisor at the Office of 4th District Supervisor, Supervisor Chaffee, Chair of the Orange County Board of Supervisors.

I am also pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics & Policy at Johns Hopkins University. 

My work spans criminal justice reform, housing access, health equity, and digital governance. 

Outside of work, I freelance in strategic funding and grant writing for mission-driven organizations.

I hope to create projects that combine data analytics with public policy--especially tools that can help change-makers make smarter, more forward-looking decisions using predictive analysis.
